            Many art museums throughout history have been designed with a
            cultural purpose or been subject to political intervention. In
            particular, national art galleries have been thought to incite
            feelings of nationalism. This has occurred in both democratic and
            non-democratic countries, although authoritarian regimes have
            historically exercised more control over administration of art
            museums. Ludwig Justi was for example dismissed as director of the
            National Gallery in Berlin in 1933 by the new authorities for not
            being politically suitable.
            <br />
            <br />

            The question of the place of the art museum in its community has
            long been under debate. Some see art museums as fundamentally
            elitist institutions, while others see them as institutions with the
            potential for societal education and uplift. John Cotton Dana, an
            American librarian and museum director, as well as the founder of
            the Newark Museum, saw the traditional art museum as a useless
            public institution, one that focused more on fashion and conformity
            rather than education and uplift. Indeed, Dana's ideal museum would
            be one best suited for active and vigorous use by the average
            citizen, located near the center of their daily movement. In
            addition, Dana's conception of the perfect museum included a wider
            variety of objects than the traditional art museum, including
            industrial tools and handicrafts that encourage imagination in areas
            traditionally considered mundane. This view of the art museum
            envisions it as one well-suited to an industrial world, indeed
            enhancing it. Dana viewed paintings and sculptures as much less
            useful than industrial products, comparing the museum to a
            department store. In addition, he encouraged the active lending-out
            of a museum's collected objects in order to enhance education at
            schools and to aid in the cultural development of individual members
            of the community. Finally, Dana saw branch museums throughout a city
            as a good method of making sure that every citizen has access to its
            benefits. Dana's view of the ideal museum sought to invest a wider
            variety of people in it, and was self-consciously not elitist.
            <br />
            <br />

            Since the 1970s, a number of political theorists and social
            commentators have pointed to the political implications of art
            museums and social relations. Pierre Bourdieu, for instance, argued
            that in spite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people's
            artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional
            music) strongly tie in with their social position. So called
            cultural capital is a major factor in social mobility (for example,
            getting a higher-paid, higher-status job). The argument states that
            certain art museums are aimed at perpetuating aristocratic and upper
            class ideals of taste and excludes segments of society without the
            social opportunities to develop such interest. The fine arts thus
            perpetuate social inequality by creating divisions between different
            social groups. This argument also ties in with the Marxist theory of
            mystification and elite culture.
            <br />
            <br />

            Furthermore, certain art galleries, such as the National Gallery in
            London and the Louvre in Paris are situated in buildings of
            considerable emotional impact. The Louvre in Paris is for instance
            located in the former Royal Castle of the ancient regime, and is
            thus clearly designed with a political agenda. It has been argued
            that such buildings create feelings of subjugation and adds to the
            mystification of fine arts. Research suggests that the context in
            which an artwork is being presented has significant influence on its
            reception by the audience, and viewers shown artworks in a museum
            rated them more highly than when displayed in a "laboratory"
            setting.
